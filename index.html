        <h2>From the Bottom of My Heart, I’m Very Sorry 😔</h2>
        <p>Oye...! 😊</p>
        <p>
          How are you? And how's your health? I found it too hard not to convey
          my wishes to you on your special day. I hope my wishes don't make you
          feel sad—that's the last thing I want.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I couldn't text you now, I might never get the chance again. So,
          take care, dear! ❤ As I’ve always said, I will never leave you alone;
          you will always be a part of my life. I don’t want to go against your
          words anymore because those are like the Gita to me. 🙏
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m sorry if I crossed any boundaries or made you feel bad or sad,
          especially after everything you said. I hope there is nothing wrong
          with how I treated you, as I've always seen you as mine. So, walk with
          pride. I wish you a fruitful and happy life ahead. 🌟
        </p>
        <p>
          Please keep smiling. 😊 Thank you for coming into my life. I promise
          that no one will feel hurt by me from now on. 🌈
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: This is not to impress anyone; it’s simply the only way I know
          to convey my wishes to my Killer.
